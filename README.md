# MathGame

This is a basic math game for *elementary school kids*.

With clicking the **start** button, random math operations appear in the screen. Application tells if your answer is correct or wrong when **send** button is clicked.

In the meantime a **timer** starts and counts the time you spend.

At the end, by clicking the **stop** button game stops and gives you your time and correct and wrong answers.
